            <p>I'm Luca Carlo, born in 1989, husband and father of four wonderful children, two girls and two boys. My
                passion for computers started when I was six years old and got my first PC running Windows 95. Since
                then,
                I've always loved exploring both hardware and software, gradually focusing more on systems, programs,
                and
                everything computers can do. Over the past ten years, I've been creating websites and dedicating myself
                more
                deeply to both web and software development. I’m constantly learning, driven by curiosity and a genuine
                love
                for technology, and that’s something I don’t think will ever change.</p>

            <p>Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a country in Southern and Western Europe. It consists of a
                peninsula that extends into the Mediterranean Sea, with the Alps on its northern land border, as well as
                nearly 800 islands, notably Sicily and Sardinia.</p>
